# Inventory-Project
a Inventory Management System

Developing By Adrian Johnston, Aldrick Gardiner


The System Will allow users to keep track of inventory levels,orders, sales and deliveries.It will also be used manufacturing industry to create a work order, bill of materials and other production-related documents.

Features of the IMS

1) Order management - Should inventory reach a specific threshold, the inventory management system will be programmed to tell managers to reorder that product. This helps companies avoid running out of products or tying up too much capital in inventory.

2) Asset tracking - When a product is in a warehouse or store, it can be tracked via its barcode and/or other tracking criteria, such as serial number, lot number or revision number. Note to developers (inventory management software often utilizes barcode, radio-frequency identification (RFID), and/or wireless tracking technology.)

3) Service management - The IMS will allow Companies that are primarily service-oriented rather than product-oriented to use it to track the cost of the materials they use to provide services, such as cleaning supplies. This way, they can attach prices to their services that reflect the total cost of performing them.

4) Product identification - The Inventory Management System will use a product identification method that will allow the user to view look up information on the products they represent. 

Paragraph to Developers (Modern inventory software programs may use QR codes or NFC tags to identify inventory items and smartphones as scanners. This method provides an option for small businesses to track inventory using barcode scanning without a need to purchase expensive scanning hardware.
Inventory optimization
A fully automated demand forecasting and inventory optimization system to attain key inventory optimization metrics such as:
  Reorder point: the number of units that should trigger a replenishment order[citation needed]
  Order quantity: the number of units that should be reordered, based on the reorder point, stock on hand and stock on order[citation needed]
  Lead demand: the number of units that will be sold during the lead time[citation needed]
  Stock cover: the number of days left before a stockout if no reorder is made[citation needed]
  Accuracy: the expected accuracy of the forecasts[citation needed])
